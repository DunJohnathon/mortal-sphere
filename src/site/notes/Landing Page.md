## The World of the Mortal Sphere
The Grand Macrocosm. A forgotten universe with no God watching over it. All that remains of creation are the first Immortals. These Immortals oversaw the emergence of Mortal ancestries over the empty sphere, and now vie for control over Mortal beliefs and activities. They promise what all of those people sought: grace, wisdom, and eternal life after death. Great wars were waged to garner the favor of immortal masters, greatest of all the Lamplit War of Lucernan, wherein Vecna raised his forces of evil against the Last Alliance of Lorian. It was thought that after Vecna was sealed inside of the Darkmoon, evil had been expelled from the Mortal Sphere for good.

It was not so.

Instead of demonizing Vecna's heretical path of lichdom, Mortals were instead enticed. Drawn to the occult secrets of Immortality, they sought to live forever on magic secrets and the ancient Mortal Shards. The civilized world is now ruled by the Holy-King Lorium-Rex, who is continually cloned by his Archmage. His court is full of emulators, who likewise seek to cement their power with life everlasting.
