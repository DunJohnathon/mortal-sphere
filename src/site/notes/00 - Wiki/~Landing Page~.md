# Welcome to The Mortal Sphere
Hello, and welcome to the Mortal Sphere wiki. This website covers the ever-expanding knowledge base of worldbuilding material that I make for my homebrew universe made specially for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. If you are new to the campaign setting, I recommend you start with the [[00 - Wiki/Introduction\|Introduction]]! From there, feel free to branch out to any area of interest to you.
